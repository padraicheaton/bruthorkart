# Bruthor Kart

## Overview

Created as a personal project to be played amongst friends during social occasions. Taking large inspiration from the Mario Kart franchise, combined with many suggestions from friends in regards to desired mechanics and features, the aim was to create something fun!

## Processes & Approaches

Agile/SCRUM, Co-Designed with stakeholders (Friends and Family).
In order to create this prototype, a modified Agile approach was used. Creating this prototype as an individual saw occasional check-ins with friends on the progress of development; these check-ins acted as the retrospective meetings that each informed the following user stories in the self-determined planning meeting. Throughout this process, the prototype was exposed to those in the target market to co-design many features and content created for the game.

## Tools Used

- Unity Game Engine
